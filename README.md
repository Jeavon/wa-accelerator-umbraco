The vast majority of use cases for this project have been solved by Windows Azure Web Sites and as such we recommend migrating yours sites. If you have any questions please open an issue - we are happy to help in any way we can.

## About
The Windows Azure Accelerator for Umbraco is designed to enable Umbraco 4.7.x applications to be easily deployed to Windows Azure, thereby eliminating the need to regularly redeploy full Windows Azure Service packages. By running in Windows Azure, Umbraco applications can benefit from the automated service management, reduced administration, high availability, and scalability provided by the Windows Azure Platform.

Please note, this accelerator is **not compatible with Umbraco 5**.
