#Windows Azure Accelerator for Umbraco

v.1.1.0

The Windows Azure Accelerator for Umbraco is designed to enable Umbraco applications to be easily deployed to Windows Azure, thereby eliminating the need to regularly redeploy full Windows Azure Service packages. By running in Windows Azure, Umbraco applications can benefit from the automated service management, reduced administration, high availability, and scalability provided by the Windows Azure Platform.

## Umbraco 5 ##
Please note, this accelerator is **not compatible with Umbraco 5**. Additionally, we do not recommend attempting to make this accelerator work with Umbraco 5. Umbraco 5 has an entirely rebuilt data provider system called [Hive](http://jupiter.umbraco.org/Data-Access-in-Umbraco-5.ashx) that can be configured to work natively with cloud storage such as Windows Azure blob storage. For more information on Umbraco 5 see <umbraco.com>. Additionally, you can find usefull information about building a Hive provider for Windows Azure blob storage in [this blog post](http://labs.thesedays.com/blog/2011/11/25/a-blob-storage-hive-provider-for-umbraco-5-beta/) and at the [Umbraco 5 contrib project](http://umbraco5contrib.codeplex.com) on Codeplex.
